          A versatile professional with diverse experience in manufacturing and
          engineering industries, coupled with a strong educational background
          in accounting. Started the career as a CNC operator at ENKEI INDONESIA
          and later transitioned to a production operator at PT Kaldu Sari
          Nabati, demonstrating the ability to adapt to different work

          Formal education at Universitas INABA, earning a bachelor's degree in
          accounting with cum laude honors, laid a solid foundation in data
          analysis, financial management, and problem-solving. Participation in
          the Full-Stack Web Development bootcamp at Dicoding Academy expanded
          my insights into the world of software development, challenging me to
          explore further in this field.

          <br />
          I have a strong desire to develop skills in software engineering and
          contribute to the development of innovative products and services.
          With dedication to learning and growth, I aim to leverage my previous
          experience and newfound education to achieve a sustainable career as a
          software engineer.
